# Familiar Desktop 0.0.40

## Highlights

- Refreshed app layout across the dashboard and settings surfaces.
- Added a new **Storage > Delete files** time-range control so you can clean up recent data by window:
  - 15 minutes
  - 1 hour
  - 1 day
  - 7 days
  - all time
- Storage cleanup now removes matching recent recording artifacts in one action, including stills, stills-markdown files, and mirrored clipboard files.

## Reliability

- Improved cleanup consistency by updating related stills manifests during deletion flows.
